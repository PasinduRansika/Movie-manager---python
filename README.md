This is a PYTHON command line app to manage collection of movies..

So this contained classes,objects,function,loops,error handlings and conditions.

The main thing was using python OOP concepts..

first it asking choice of the menu.

The menus are movie adding menu,view all movies,search movie,delete movie,update movie.

    in movie adding menu - it will get movie ID and check whether it is already exits. after it asks input for these - moive title,director,release year,genre 

    in view all movies menu - this will show every movie that stored and if there is nothing it will show a message "No movies added yet".

    in search movie menu -this will ask to enter the the movie title and this show every movie details related to the title that entered.

    in delete movie and update movie menus ask the movie id to delete and upadate (this contained all the things that are in the movie adding menu ) after this there is a confirmation to complete the operation.
